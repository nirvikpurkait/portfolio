This is guide to follow when creating a components

# `<component-name.ui.tsx>`

Before creating a component, if you are making use of a `shadncn/ui` components, if you are not using the default ui and you need to make some changes, please make a copy of the component outside of the default folder. And and add the extension as `.ui.tsx`.

e.g - If you want to customize the button color, insted of customizing it directly on `button.tsx`, create a `button.ui.tsx` and customize it as you need, and leave `button.tsx` as it is.
